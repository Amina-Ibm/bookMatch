# BookMatch

A Flutter-based mobile app made as my Final Year Project.  It helps users search for books, manage their reading lists, receive AI-based book recommendations, and scan books using their ISBN barcode. The app uses GetX for state management and Firebase as its backend.

## Features

🔍 **Search for Books**: Users can search for books by title.

📚 **Reading List Management**: Organize books into "To Read", "Currently Reading", and "Read" categories.

🤖 **AI-Based Recommendations**: Get content-based, user-based and mood-based book recommendations.

📷 **ISBN Book Scanner**: Scan book barcodes to retrieve book details.

🔥 **Firebase Integration**: Store and manage reading lists in Firestore.

🛒 **Buy on Amazon**: Users can purchase books directly through Amazon with a seamless redirection to the store.
